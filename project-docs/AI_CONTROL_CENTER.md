## 3. R3-R21 independent review

```text
IMPLEMENTATION_COMMIT = 1587b20b3920618b79b335c66bbdde1778570626
EXECUTION_BASELINE = 9853f018b2f759c8da19e0f2713216584a3f2113
SCOPE_REVIEW = PASS
SOURCE_REVIEW = FAIL / CORRECTIVE REQUIRED
STATUS = NOT PASS / NOT CLOSED
PRIVACY_PURGE_REQUIRED = NO
```

Accepted from R3-R21:
- pure raw `outputAsync()` no-op buffers with no source structural repair;
- deterministic workbook blocker normalization restored;
- strict actual dimension fingerprinting preserved;
- exact `localSheetId` print-area binding preserved;
- `Sheet1.colsHash` proof remains present.

Remaining bounded defect:
- mutation-specific negative tests use the potentially-invalid raw Part B roundtrip fingerprint/buffer as their baseline. In the raw-degradation branch, those tests can pass on a pre-existing dimension mismatch instead of the intended mutation, so proof isolation is not reliable.

## 4. Owner priority / current gate

```text
COMPLETE D2 FULLY BEFORE D3.

D1 = PASS / CLOSED
D2 = IN PROGRESS
D2-WP003 = CORRECTIVE REQUIRED / NOT CLOSED
D2-WP003-R3-R21 = REVIEWED / NOT PASS / NOT CLOSED
ACTIVE_WORK_PACKAGE = NONE
ACTIVE_D2_SOURCE_CHANGE_AUTH = NONE
ACTIVE_KINTONE_WRITE_AUTH = NONE
ACTIVE_DEPLOY_AUTH = NONE
PRIVACY_PURGE_REQUIRED = NO
D3 = HOLD UNTIL D2 PASS / CLOSED
ANTIGRAVITY = STOP / WAIT OWNER
```

## 5. Next proposed D2 corrective — NOT AUTHORIZED

```text
PROPOSED_WORK_PACKAGE = D2-WP003-R3-R22
PROPOSED_WORK_PACKAGE_NAME = VALID SOURCE-BACKED NEGATIVE BASELINES + RAW NO-OP RESULT PINNING
PROPOSED_SCOPE = TEST-ONLY
PROPOSED_STATUS = WAIT OWNER AUTHORIZATION
```

Intent:
- source implementation from R3-R21 stays read-only;
- mutation-specific negatives must start from independently valid exact-source/source-backed evidence;
- actual dimension-removal proof must start from a buffer known to contain the source tag;
- raw no-op truth remains separate and is evaluated honestly with the real validator;
- deterministic normalization proof must not be satisfied by a pre-existing raw parity defect.

No next blocker auto-start.
