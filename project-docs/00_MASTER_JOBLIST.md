## 0. Non-negotiable rules

```text
REPOSITORY_AND_ACCEPTED_LIVE_EVIDENCE_BEAT_CHAT_MEMORY = YES
NO_FALSE_PASS = YES
EXECUTOR_CANNOT_SELF_CERTIFY = YES
ANTIGRAVITY_MINIMUM_NECESSARY_ONLY = YES
CLAUDE_READ_ONLY_SECOND_REVIEW_MINIMUM_NECESSARY_ONLY = YES
NO_LIVE_KINTONE_WRITE_OR_DEPLOY_WITHOUT_EXACT_AUTH = YES
COMPLETE_D2_BEFORE_D3 = YES
```

## 1. D1

```text
D1 = PASS / CLOSED
FINAL_D1_SECURITY_REVIEW = PASS
```

Frozen unless proven regression.

## 2. D2 — Excel + PDF Original/Legacy Format

```text
D2 = IN PROGRESS
D2-WP001 = PASS / CLOSED
D2-WP002 = PASS / CLOSED
D2-WP003-R3-R22 = PASS / CLOSED
D2-WP003-R3-R30 = PASS / CLOSED
D2_PRESERVATION_GATE = PASS / CLOSED
R3-R30_IMPLEMENTATION_COMMIT = d15261eadbc726ea87f11085253c026fedada381
D2-PRESERVATION-PARTB-SHEETPR-DECISION-01 = OPTION B APPROVED
CONTROL_PLANE_REVIEW_CORRECTIVE_ROUND = 8 OF 20
ACTIVE_D2_WORK_PACKAGE = NONE
PROPOSED_NEXT_D2_ACTION = REFERENCE-IMAGE CLOSURE
PREFERRED_EXECUTION = CHATGPT READ-ONLY REVIEW FIRST
ACTIVE_D2_TEST_CHANGE_AUTH = NONE
ACTIVE_D2_SOURCE_CHANGE_AUTH = NONE
```

The OOXML preservation gate is closed. R3-R29 production source is accepted and R3-R30 completed the final bounded proof gaps without production changes. GitHub exposes no independent CI/status/workflow signal for R3-R30, so no independent runtime execution claim is made.

D2 must still close:
- reference-image handling;
- 5–10 Part A objectives;
- 6→8 Part B competency blocks;
- no-formula authority;
- production sanitizer/XLSX renderer;
- combined Excel parity;
- PDF parity;
- export security/privacy regression;
- final independent D2 review.

## 3. D3

Protected READ-ONLY sources: `283, 310, 305, 643, 307, 640, 715, 716`.

```text
D3 = HOLD UNTIL D2 PASS / CLOSED
D3_WRITE_AUTH = NONE
```

## 4. D4

App800 HR Control Center E2E. Must include Employee Lifecycle Change operations. Status: `IN PROGRESS / NOT ACTIVE`.

## 5. D5

Copy Own Previous MBO. Carry-forward whitelist only; fresh target-year routing/identity. Status: `IN PROGRESS / NOT ACTIVE`.

## 6. D6

Integrated E2E / Security / Regression. Status: `PENDING`.

## 7. D7

Admin Support Center. `admin-form` is technical/recovery only. Status: `SOURCE FUNCTIONALITY CLOSED`.

## 8. Current exact next action

```text
NEXT_EXECUTOR = OWNER
NEXT_ACTION = SAY `ต่อ` TO START CHATGPT READ-ONLY REFERENCE-IMAGE CLOSURE REVIEW
ACTIVE_WORK_PACKAGE = NONE
ANTIGRAVITY = STOP
CLAUDE = STOP
D3 = HOLD
```

## 9. Project-close condition

```text
D1 = PASS
D2 = PASS
D3 = PASS
D4 = PASS
D5 = PASS
D6 = PASS
D7 = PASS
P0_DEFECTS_OPEN = 0
